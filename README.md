# EEG Time-Frequency Anaysis

## Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
 Time-Frequency decomposition of the raw EEG signals into multiple levels using db4 wavelet. The code can be extended to methods in [1] and [2].

## Morlet Wavelet
Time-Frequency transformation of EEG signals using morlet wavelet transform. For detailed information about morelet transform refer to [3].

## Baseline Normalization
Normalization of EEG signals in time-frequency domain. Details of why baseline normalization is important refer to [3] and [4].
